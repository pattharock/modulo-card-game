This file contains instructions for running the program. 

The 6 classes are 
	Card.java
	Deck.java
	Player.java
	Dealer.java
	Game.java
	GUIGame.java

The main function is in the GUIGame.java

The Commands to run the program are:
	javac GUIGame.java
	java GUIGame

Note:
 If running the code via the terminal, the 52 image files to be used should all
 be located inside the src folder.

 If running the code via Eclipse or IntelliJ, the 52 image files should be 
located outside the src folder, at the same level with it, i.e. inside the project folder

In order for the code to run in both cases, the images SHOULD NOT be in the images folder and instead the 52 images files should be located individually in the required location.
